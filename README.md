During the Spring 2024 semester at Las Positas College, I collaborated with my Math 2 professor, Alain Olavarrieta, on developing an algorithm in Python to calculate the cosine of a user-inputted value with a precision of 15 decimal places. This project delved deep into the mathematical foundations of the Taylor/Maclaurin series, which we utilized to achieve our desired accuracy.

Throughout this endeavor, I extensively researched various Taylor/Maclaurin series applications, correlating them with real-world scenarios to ensure our algorithm was both practical and efficient. The project ended up having a few limitations due to the system on which it was run and tested.

Working alongside Professor Olavarrieta provided invaluable insights into advanced mathematical concepts and computational techniques. This project honed my research skills, fostered my ability to collaborate with a mentor, and developed my patience in debugging and refining complex algorithms. The iterative process of testing and improving our code was crucial in achieving the high precision required.

**GENERAL THINGS TO KNOW WHEN RUNNING**
<br />
If you want to multiply π by a number (ex: 2π), in the console, enter '2*pi'
<br />
This program can be slightly innacurate when it comes to very large numbers as it was developed and tested on a MacBook Pro
